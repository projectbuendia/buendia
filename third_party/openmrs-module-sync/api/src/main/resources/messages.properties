sync.help.heading=Help with synchronization, importing, and exporting
sync.help.whatIsSynchronization=What is Synchronization?
sync.help.whatIsSynchronizationAnswer=Synchronization is when you have multiple sites using OpenMRS, and you want them to copy data to each other.  In this situation, one site has to act as the &quot;Parent&quot;, and one acts as the &quot;Child&quot;.  The Parent is always the computer or site that is most central.  Any site can choose <b>only one</b> Parent.  However, a Parent can have many Child sites/servers. 
sync.help.whatIsDifferenceSyncAndImportExport=What is the difference between &quot;Synchronization&quot; vs. &quot;Generic Import&quot; and &quot;Generic Export&quot;? 
sync.help.whatIsDifferenceSyncAndImportExportAnswer=Synchronization means that the machines copying data to each other keep track of what has or hasn't been sent.  Generically importing and exporting allows you to export patient data from your system, and then import it to another system, but the 2 systems do not keep track of what data has been passed.
sync.help.howDoIUseSynchronization=How do I use Synchronization?
sync.help.howDoIUseSynchronizationAnswer=There are 2 different ways to use Synchronization, depending on your connectivity.  You can: <ol><li>Synchronize via File/Disk</li><li>Synchronize via Web</li></ol>  <p>Synchronizing via File/Disk means that the Child server will copy all of its new data to a file, which you can save on a disk.  That disk can then be carried to a Parent server at a different site, and then the file can be uploaded on the Parent server.  In this situation, the Parent server generates a response to be carried back to the Child.  This technique allows you to synchronize without Internet connectivity.  <p>Synchronizing via the Web allows you to simply click a button to send data to the Parent, receive the response, and process it.  The technique is useful if there is connectivity between the Parent and Child..<p>You can also set up a scheduled(automatic) synchronization via Web after every interval of time that you can decide according to your connectivity and your server/site activity(data changes rate).
sync.help.howDoIConfigureParent=How do I configure a Parent server to send data to (if this is a Child server)?
sync.help.howDoIConfigureParentAnswer=Go to the <a href="config.list">configuration</a> page.  At the top, you can set up a Parent server, and test the connection.  You only need to do this if you plan on synchronizing via the web. Remember that the username and password you use to connect to Parent server must have been registered at the Parent side before you can make any connection to the Parent.
sync.help.howDoIConfigureChild=How do I configure a Child server to receive from (if this is a Parent server)?
sync.help.howDoIConfigureChildAnswer=If your server is to act as a Parent, you do not to configure anything.  However, any Child servers will need a username and password which will authorize them to post changes.
sync.help.howDoISendToParentViaWeb=How do I Synchronize via the Web?
sync.help.howDoISendToParentViaWebAnswer=Synchronizing via the Web is easy, and only requires the press of a button, which you can find <a href="status.list">here</a>.
sync.help.howDoISendToParentViaDisk=How do I Synchronize via File/Disk?
sync.help.howDoISendToParentViaDiskAnswer=From the Child server, you must <a href="status.list">Export to File</a> and save the resulting file to disk.  Take that disk to the Parent server, and login.  Once logged in, <a href="import.list">import data from Child</a> to upload the data into the Parent system.  Doing so will generate a response file.  Save this file to the disk again, and this time take it back to the Child server.  Once logged in to the Child server, <a href="status.list">upload response from parent</a> so that the Child server knows that the Parent has received the sent data/file.
sync.help.howDoIEditSyncRecordRetails=How do I view/edit Sync Records ?
sync.help.howDoIEditSyncRecordRetailsAnswer=Go to the <a href="history.list">History of Changes</a> page , at the bottom you can find a list of changes to be synchronized.By clicking one of them ,you wiil be redirected to the record editing page.This page can help to manage some failing sync records.
