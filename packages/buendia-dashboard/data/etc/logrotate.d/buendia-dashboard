# The Buendia server writes its requests logs to /var/log/large/requests,
# in files named by client IP address.  The logrotate configuration for
# that directory is maintained in the buendia-monitoring package.  With
# buendia-dashboard installed, however, buendia-distill will frequently
# empty out /var/log/large/requests -- it processes the request logs, writes
# out the distilled log information to /usr/local/opt/buendia/distilled, then
# moves the log files away to prevent them from being processed twice.
# The original logs are placed in /var/log/requests so that they remain
# available for a while; we need logrotate to clean up /var/log/requests
# often, as the request log files can grow rapidly.
