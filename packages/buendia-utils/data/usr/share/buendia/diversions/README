# Diversions of existing files owned by other packages go in this directory.
# If the file to replaced is at $path, then its replacement should be at
# /usr/local/opt/buendia/diversions/$path.  For example, if a package wants to
# replace /etc/motd, it should include /usr/local/opt/buendia/diversions/etc/motd
# and invoke "buendia-divert $1 /etc/motd" in its postinst and prerm scripts.
