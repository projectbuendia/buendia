# The files in this directory contain settings for Buendia components.
#
# All files must work when sourced as bash scripts, and represent settings
# by setting shell variables.
#
# Each filename (except "README" and "id") should start with a two-digit
# priority level and should be named after the package that owns it to avoid
# collision, e.g. "10-foo" for the default values of all settings used by
# "buendia-foo".  The files are loaded in order from the lowest number to the
# greatest, so later files (higher numbers) can override the settings in
# earlier files (lower numbers).  Numbers should be assigned as follows:
#
# 10-19: universal default values as defined by the package that owns them
# 20-29: locally autogenerated values generated by the package that owns them
# 30-39: any other settings that need priority lower than the site
# 40-49: the site configuration file, shipped with the site package
# 50-59: any other settings that need priority higher than the site
# 80-89: manual configuration, hand-edited by user
# 90-99: master overrides generated by recovery or maintenance tools
#
# The variable names should be all-caps and prefixed with the name of the
# package that owns them, e.g. the settings for the "buendia-foo" package
# should have names starting with "FOO_".  For example, if the buendia-foo
# package needs a setting named FOO_COLOR that defaults to grey across all
# installations, "FOO_COLOR=grey" goes in 10-foo.  If the buendia-foo package
# autogenerates a color to replace the default, it puts that setting in 20-foo.
# If the "buendia-bar" package wants to change this setting, it can put a file
# at 30-bar or 50-bar.  If the system is deployed to the "xyz" site, then the
# buendia-site-xyz package places the site-specific settings in 40-site-xyz.
