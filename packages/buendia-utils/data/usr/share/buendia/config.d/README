# Configuration scripts for each package go in this directory.  The job
# of configuration scripts is to apply the settings in /usr/local/opt/buendia/site
# to the rest of the system.  For example, if the buendia-foo package has a
# web page with a color that is configured by the FOO_COLOR setting, the
# package should provide a script at /usr/local/opt/buendia/config.d/foo that reads
# the FOO_COLOR setting and updates the web page to have the desired color.
