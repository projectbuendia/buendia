# When the server is in wifi client mode (connecting to an external AP), we've
# observed that it sometimes loses its connection to the wifi AP after a
# couple of days, resulting in a major outage of the system; we don't know if
# it's due to the server's wifi hardware, driver software, or a problem with
# the wifi AP.  However, we do know that in this state a simple reboot brings
# everything back to working order.  This watchdog checks if the server has
# fallen off the wifi network, and kicks wpa_supplicant to make it rejoin.
